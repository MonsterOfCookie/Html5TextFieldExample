# TextField, Stop the screen scrolling on space bar input

Simples, just look at the javascript that controls the input.

Add extra key codes for other input you want to catch.

do `./gradlew html:superDev` then go to `http://127.0.0.1:9090/index.html` and resize the browser window until you get scroll bars then type some spaces!
